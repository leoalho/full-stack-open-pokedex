I have chosen python as the language in this exercise. Linting in python cam be done with pylint: an external library which checks if the code is according to PEP-standards. Pylibt can be run both as a CLI and embedded in many code editors. PEP is the most common guideline for style conventions in python. Unit and integration testing in python can be done for rxample with pytest. Python does not require building at all but to create an executable from a python project PyInstaller could be used.
There are many CI alternarives to Jenkins and github actions. Naturally the bigggest cloud service providers, Microsoft and Amazon provide their own CI tools: Azure Devops server and AWS codepipeline. Other alternatives are Bamboo, TeamCity, CircleCI.
The decision between self-hosted and cloud services depends on the type of project the team is working on. If the team is making a project which could grow quickly and unpredictably then cloud based services offer better load balancing. There is also no need for any maintenance of server hardware when hosting a project via the cloud.
If it is for one reason or the other important to know where the data of the project is stored physically, for example for legal reasons, then self hosting could be the more favourable solution.Â When self hosting the group has also full record on any incidents that could happen.
